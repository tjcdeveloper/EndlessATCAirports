------------------------------

### `YMML` Melbourne Airport

This is the main airport of the airspace. There is custom traffic, similar to reality. It may get a bit challanging as the airport in real life can only hold up to 55 aircraft inbound.

Aircraft will use the following STARS:

* `ARBEY6A` (north, north-west)
* `LIZZI8A` (north-east, east)
* `WAREN7A` (south, south-east)
* `WENDY9A` (west, south-west)

There are more STARS, however due to limitations to the game at the moment, they will not be included. This includes some RNAV approaches and non-jet STARS. 

ALL aircraft must follow the STAR until `BELTA`. The only execption is the `LIZZI8A`, where aircraft may fly direct to `BELTA` after `LIZZI`.

Aircraft will use the following SIDS:

* `DOSEL1`, `NONIX3`, `MNG3` (these all follow the same routing up until `PEART`; north, north-east)
* `KEPPA2` (north)
* `SUNTI3` (south)
* `CRENA1`, `ESDIG3` (west, south-west)
* `CORRS9` (east)
* `NEVIS7` (north-west)

Aircraft may travel direct to the last waypoint on the SID, but only for seperation purposes.
