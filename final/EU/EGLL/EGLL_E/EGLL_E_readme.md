Endless ATC Heathrow Easterlies v2.0 by Zac. Join the Endless ATC discord at https://discord.gg/v4wDGh3

This file simulates Heathrow in the westerly configuration.

The vectoring is too complex to be explained in a readme - I recommend using flightradar24.com to see how they do it.

---------------------------------------------------------

There are no STARs covered by Heathrow Director - aircraft are handed off inbound BIG, BNN, LAM or OCK. Realistically, vectors can only given from and after these points (aircraft leave the VOR on a specified heading).


The minimum separation for aircraft not on a localiser is 3nm. Aircraft on the same localiser must be separated by at least 2.5nm.


There are two ATZs (aerodrome traffic zones) partially located within the London CTR. The parts of the ATZs which are inside the CTR are known as LFAs (local flying areas). The rest of the ATZ is just an ATZ.

Denham is the one to the north, and White Waltham is the one to the west. The minimum altitude is 500ft above the top of the ATZ/LFA. 

For the Denham ATZ, the minimum altitude is 2800ft. For the Denham LFA, the minimum altitude is 1500ft.

For the White Waltham ATZ, the minimum altitude is 2700ft. For the White Waltham LFA, the minimum altitude is 2000ft.
