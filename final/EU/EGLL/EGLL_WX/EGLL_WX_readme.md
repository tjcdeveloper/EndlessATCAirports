Endless ATC Heathrow Extended v1.1 by Zac. Join the Endless ATC discord at https://discord.gg/v4wDGh3

This file simulates Heathrow with the proposed and highly controversial third runway.

The vectoring is too complex to be explained in a readme - I recommend using flightradar24.com to see how they do it.

---------------------------------------------------------

There are no STARs covered by Heathrow Director - aircraft are handed off inbound BIG, BNN, LAM or OCK. Realistically, vectors can only given from and after these points (aircraft leave the VOR on a specified heading).


The minimum separation for aircraft not on a localiser is 3nm. Aircraft on the same localiser must be separated by at least 2.5nm.


There are three lines across the localiser, simulating real world restrictions on descent. From east to west, the minimum altitudes are 4000ft, 3000ft, and 2500ft. The 4000ft line does not extend to the southern runway, to allow aircraft to establish at 3000ft.
