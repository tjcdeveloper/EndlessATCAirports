Endless ATC Heathrow 27s v2.0 by Zac. Join the Endless ATC discord at https://discord.gg/v4wDGh3

This file simulates Heathrow in the 27 configuration.

The vectoring is too complex to be explained in a readme - I recommend using flightradar24.com to see how they do it.

---------------------------------------------------------

There are no STARs covered by Heathrow Director - aircraft are handed off descending to FL90 inbound BIG, BNN, LAM or OCK. Realistically, vectors can only given from and after these points (aircraft leave the VOR on a specified heading).

The minimum separation for aircraft not on a localiser is 3nm. Aircraft on the same localiser must be separated by at least 2.5nm.

There are three lines across the localisers, simulating real world restrictions on descent. From east to west, the minimum altitudes are 4000ft, 3000ft, and 2500ft.
