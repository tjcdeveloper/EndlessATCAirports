Endless ATC Heathrow Westerlies v3.0 by Zac. Join the Endless ATC discord at https://discord.gg/v4wDGh3

This file simulates Heathrow in the westerly configuration.

The vectoring is too complex to be explained in a readme - I recommend using flightradar24.com to see how they do it.

---------------------------------------------------------

There are no STARs covered by Heathrow Director - aircraft are handed off inbound BIG, BNN, LAM or OCK. Realistically, vectors can only given from and after these points (aircraft leave the VOR on a specified heading).


The minimum separation for aircraft not on a localiser is 3nm. Aircraft on the same localiser must be separated by at least 2.5nm.


There are three lines across the localisers, simulating real world restrictions on descent. From east to west, the minimum altitudes are 4000ft, 3000ft, and 2500ft.


There is one ATZ (aerodrome traffic zone) partially located within the London CTR. The part of the ATZ which is inside the CTR is known as an LFA (local flying areas). The rest of the ATZ is just an ATZ.

Denham is to the north. The minimum altitude is 500ft above the top of the ATZ/LFA. 

For the Denham ATZ, the minimum altitude is 2800ft. For the Denham LFA, the minimum altitude is 1500ft. This does apply to Northolt departures.
