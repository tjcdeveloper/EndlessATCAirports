# Manchester Airport including Liverpool John Lennon Airport for Endless ATC

This implements Manchester Airport (EGCC) and Liverpool John Lennon Airport (EGGP) into [Endless ATC](https://steamcommunity.com/app/666610).

## Installation
To install this airport you will need to copy the [EGCC.txt](./EGCC.txt) file into your steam directory, which by default for Windows 10 is at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common`. From the common folder you need to put the file into the `Endless ATC\locations` folder.

## Features

This fully implements all published SIDs and STARs according to the charts published by [VatSIM](https://www.vatsim.uk/) on [ChartFox](https://chartfox.org/EGCC). As is normal for the UK, all STARs end in holding patterns. The published approaches have been used as a base for the approaches implemented in game. There have been some minor modifications to get them to work in game without any problems.

There are two configurations, one Easterly and one Westerly, which start with one runway open for landing and one for take off at EGCC. This is the way they normally operate. After you reach a score of 7 EGGP will open its single runway.

Airlines and the aircraft they use have been approximated using data available on [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/airports/man) and random private traffic has been added in.
