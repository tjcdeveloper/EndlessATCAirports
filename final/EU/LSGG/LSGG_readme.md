## Basic Operations
### Departures
All departures have an initial climb of FL90. Most departures are towards the north and the northeast.
### Arrivals
All arrivals come in at the limit of the TMA FL160. The majority of arrivals are vectored downwind for the active runway and take an extended downwind in cases of high traffic. Holdings are outside of the Arrivals TMA and operated by Swiss Radar. There is significant terrain on the north and south side of the airport.
## Known Issues
* Celing, climb and descend altitudes restricted by game mechanics
* BENOT arrival restricted to GG514 only onto BENOT1N RWY04 due to IAF on AOR edge
* ULMES arrival restricted to GG512 only onto ULMES1P RWY04 due to IAF on AOR edge, chosen to balance out traffic on either downwind
### Merged SIDs
* AKITO with DJL and LUSAR - common AOR boundry entry, Enters DINIG hold due no point before downwind
* BANKO with KINES - common AOR boundry entry, next point in used before downwind
* ULMES with FRI - Common AOR Boundry Entry, both direct GG512 with different final turns
