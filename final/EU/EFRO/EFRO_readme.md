---------------------------------------------------------

The platform altitude for both runways is 2400ft, but descend all aircraft to 3000ft and allow them to descend further automatically.

The only way to make high traffic levels work at this airport is by utilising the holds.

Aircraft should generally fly an arrival and not be vectored at all. Where necessary, aircraft should be vectored to intercept at 10 miles at 2400ft.

The initial climb for all departures is 5000ft. Since some TMA exit points are also entry points, be extremely cautious giving anything above FL90 initially.

The minimum separation in the TMA is 5nm. Aircraft on the localiser must be separated by 7nm, as per ICAO single runway minima. During periods of high intensity arrivals, reduced minima of 3nm may be used. Departures via the same exit point must be separated by 12nm on TMA exit.

All arrivals which have a downwind, provided there is no need to hold, should be issued descent to be level at 6000ft abeam the airport. This will allow for continous descent. Passing around 7000ft, if no traffic is conflicting, they should be given descent to 3000ft and allowed to establish on the approach without further input.

Departures should simply be climbed to ensure separation from arrivals and other departures.
