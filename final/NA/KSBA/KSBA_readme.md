# Santa Barbara TRACON For Endless ATC

This is my rendition of KSBA / Santa Barbara Tracon. I also have KCMA (yes it is technically under Point Migu Approach not Santa Barbara but oh well I like it there) to add some more GA traffic. This is a fun little airport to control, with a few unique challenges. Right now it is setup to land and depart 25, and land 33R. Feel free to land on both but IRL operations only put the airliners on 25 typically (if i'm not mistaken) so try doing it single runway for the added challenge.

## Features

### Implemented

* Both KSBA and KCMA
* 5 KSBA Sids, KWANG.GINNA, FLOUT.GVO, FLOUT.VTU, GAUCH.MQO, MISHN.NNAVY
* Semi realistic airlines - major operators and GA have been included.

## Changelog

* 1.0 - 10/30/2020 - Initial Release.
