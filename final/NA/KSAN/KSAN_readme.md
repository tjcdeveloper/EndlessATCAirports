# SOCAL West (San Diego) For Endless ATC

This is my rendition of San Diego TRACON, also known as SOCAL West (it is a SOCAL facility). San Diego is the busiest single runway airport in the world, making it one heck of a challenge for approach. I will warn you now, this is a seriously difficult custom airport. You better be up for the challange! Yes I know the only ILS approach is on runway 9, but that is really never used except for extreme weather situations. Runway 27 does have a localizer approach though, and so you will just have to use your imagination and pretend that the aircraft are on a localizer and not an ILS.

## Guide

I figured I should really add a basic guide to how the airport operates so you can really get the most out of this custom airport without ripping your head out. 

Departures are not a huge concern, CWARD and PADRZ go the same direction and are almost identical, BORDER and ZOOM are pretty similar. When an arrival pops up, I ususally just increase the alitude immedietly to get it out the way. Your arrival and departure flows shouldnt really need to mix.

Arrivals are where things get a little more tricky. For aircraft on the LUCKI1 STAR (from the east - HSKER is the fix) I normally just leave them. It is quite rare that I actually take them off the arrival. The COMIX2 STAR (from the north-west down the coast - COMIX fix) is where I spend most of my energy managing. If you look at the actual chart for the COMIX2 arrival you will notice the SID ends with a radar vector north and parralel to the localizer in the opposite direction. Approach would then provide radar vectors to sequence them in on the localizer. This isnt a thing in EndlessATC however, and so I have the approach run parralel, and then turn to join the localizer at the same point as the LUCKI1 arrivals. For 99% of my COMIX2 arrivals I drop them down to 2000 - 3000 ft and turn them onto the localizer way earlier to sequence them ahead / behind my LUCKI1 arrivals that should already be established. Its really a challenge and takes a lot of focus.

Hope this helps a little, good luck with this one! I tend to manually keep the skill at about 7 - 8 or else it just gets unmanageable.
