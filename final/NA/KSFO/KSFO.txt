# where identifier is a unique name used to define a runway usage configuration below
# name is one or two digits, optionally suffixed with an L, R or C character
# position is the location of the beginning of the runway (including displaced threshold)
# length is in feet
# displaced threshold length in feet (for landings), displaced2 is for the other end of the runway
# elevation is in feet, and must be within 1000 feet difference from the airspace ground elevation defined above
# glideslope is the angle in degrees; the default value is 3
# localizer is the true heading in degrees of the ILS until touchdown; by default it's the same as runway true heading, but a small offset is allowed
# beacon is a point on the localizer at a certain distance (NM) from the threshold
# second beacon is a point on the localizer when runway is used in opposite direction (rev)

## name, amount, planetype, pronunciation, <direction>
# name is the 3 letter airline code, or a private regristration (with a land code, dash(-), and then the format)
# amount determines the relative likelihood of appearance (e.g. 0=never, 1=occasionally, 10=frequently, etc)
# planetype determines plane characteristics, put a dash (/) between multiple types for random type selection
# pronuniation is the callsign, used for airlines
# direction lets the plane arrive/depart in (more or less) the specified direction:
# give the direction as a string containing one or more of the letters nwse, for north west south east,
# but make sure there are actually entrypoints defined at those directions (approximately); w needs an entrypoint near 270

# custom plane types, useful when specified custom types in the airline lists above, or to override default type properties
# category is the weight category: 1 to 6, meaning superheavy=1, upperheavy, lowerheavy, uppermedium, lowermedium, light=6
# turnrate is in degrees per second
# descendrate is in feet per minute
# accelrate is in knots per second
# manufacturer name is optional, only used for private callsign pronunciation in usa mode

## score, identifier, use, <offsetheading>, <nosid>
# score is the score (skill) at which the runway will be activated
# identifier is a unique runway name specified earlier
# use is a string (without spaces) that may contain these words: start, land, rev, int, track
# where rev means reversed use (opposite direction), int means intersection departure (takeoffs begin 30% down the rwy), track means backtrack after landing
# offsetheading means planes will fly a specific heading just after takeoff (especially useful for allowing parallel takeoffs with divergent headings)
# nosid option means planes will depart on the given offsetheading, with SID mode disabled
# when rwy configurations are omited, two configs are automatically created, one for each rwy direction, with all runways active
