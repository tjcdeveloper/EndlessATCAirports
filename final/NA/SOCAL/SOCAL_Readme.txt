This Sector is KLAX (Socal) It includes much of Socal with Palmdale.

Ive Implemented the most essential sids and stars (all of them are not needed since some are in generally the same direction as others)
LAX, PMD, PSP, SAN, BUR, LGB, VNY, SNA, ONT, CQH, MYF, and SMO are included.
SMO has Limited traffic due to the limited runway length
"Separation = 0" is an optional line that you can add a # infront of it to completely remove it, or just remove the line
GA Traffic is included at every aiport except LAX (this may or may not change in the future)
The special airlines that dont fly to these airports are uncluded under # Specials (some are ga airlines i.e Delta private jets and NetJets)
Hope you enjoy :D
